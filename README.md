# 🌸 Kathakalam - Onam Kathakali Pookkalam

This project generates a traditional **Onam Pookkalam (flower carpet)** pattern using Python and Matplotlib.  
It combines math, geometry, and cultural art to create a vibrant traditional design programmatically. The design features a minimalistic Kathakali face in the centre along with a "Happy Onam" text in Malayalam.

## 📝 Description
The Pookkalam Generator is a creative coding project inspired by the floral carpets made during the festival of **Onam** in Kerala, India.  
It uses:
- **Matplotlib** for drawing geometric, symmetrical floral patterns.
- Randomized color choices for variety.
- Parametric shapes (circles, petals, layers) to simulate traditional designs.

This project demonstrates the blend of **art + math + code** and can be extended with:
- Custom color palettes
- Malayalam text rendering
- Pattern symmetry variations
